 Intersecting elements and segments found.
 Review the mesh connectivity in CADFEKO and correct the CAD model
 or merge coincident vertices for mesh models.
 Incorrectly detected intersections might be caused by model extents
 that are set too large or by the maximum identical distance that is
 set incorrectly for the mesh.
